This is a functional Wonder Mail S Decoder made using the code for the Generator found here: https://altissimo1.github.io/Side-Series/Mystery-Dungeon/Explorers/wm-generator.html

As it turns out, all the code needed to decode existing passwords was also within the back end, given this is recovered from the old site where the original generator could have been found it's likely all the Wonder Mail tools on that site used the same code base, as such all I did was create a new front end.

It's not a complete decoder, all I'm doing is decoding it and outputting the raw data to the screen with annotations to give context for what some of these raw numbers mean, but I haven't bothered to annotate everything, I've chosen to only annotate that which I've got premade functions for, as well as rewardType, since that only has 7 options.

If you wish to finish it or pretty it up, feel free.
